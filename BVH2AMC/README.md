# scripts for converting BVH files to ACM format

> I am trying to script a BVH to ACM converter. I have a BVH file that I want to convert to ACM format. I have the following code that reads the BVH file and extracts the joint positions and rotations. I am not sure how to convert this data to ACM format. Can you help me with this?
